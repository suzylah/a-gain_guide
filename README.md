# A-GAIN GUIDE

## About the project
The A–GAIN–GUIDE is a platform promoting repair, reuse, upcycling and recycling of clothes in Berlin, thereby revealing the potential of your used clothes. The [MAP](https://a-gain.guide/map) shows textile recycling stakeholders registered on the A-GAIN GUIDE, as well as their contact details. With the filter functions the search can be narrowed down to find relevant results faster. The [GUIDE](https://a-gain.guide/guide) will help identify the right solution for a user and their garment how to prolongue the life of their clothes.
